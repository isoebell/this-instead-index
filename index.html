                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        <em>Why is it that men have always had power, influence, wealth and fame, while women have had nothing but children? 
                        In this essay, first published in 1929, Woolf exhorts young women to take advantage of the opportunities they have.
                        A Room of One’s Own, based on a lecture given at Girton College Cambridge, is one of the great feminist polemics. 
                        Woolf’s blazing writing on female creativity, the role of the writer, and the silent fate of Shakespeare’s imaginary sister 
                        remains a powerful reminder of a woman’s need for financial independence and intellectual freedom.

                        <em>Beloved comedian, podcaster and commentator Price's debut book explores obsession and self-image, 
                        and how while striving to be hot feels natural, particularly in our culture, it is dangerous, homogenous, 
                        and informed by patriarchy. Anchored in her own personal experience, All I Ever Wanted Is to Be Hot is a refreshingly 
                        honest interrogation of how pop culture, the internet and modern beauty ideals intersect to influence our bodies and how we feel about them.

                        <em>Jack Charles has worn many hats throughout his life: actor, cat burglar, musician, heroin addict, activist, even Senior Victorian Australian of the Year. But the title he’s most proud to claim is that of Aboriginal Elder.
                        <br>
                        Stolen from his mother and placed into institutional care when he was only a few months old, Uncle Jack was raised under the government’s White Australia Policy. 
                        The loneliness and isolation he experienced during those years had a devastating impact on him that endured long after he reconnected with his Aboriginal roots and discovered his stolen identity. 
                        Even today he feels like an outsider; a loner; a fringe dweller.
                        <br>
                        In this honest and no-holds-barred memoir, Uncle Jack reveals the ‘ups and downs of this crazy, drugged up, locked up, fucked up, and at times unbelievable, life’. 
                        From his sideline as a cat burglar, battles with drug addiction and stints in prison, to gracing the nation’s stages and screens as he dazzled audiences with his big personality and acting prowess, he takes us through the most formative moments of his life.

                        <em>Extra Bold is the inclusive, practical, and informative career handbook for designers that we've all been waiting for. Written collaboratively by a diverse team of authors, the book opens with critical essays that rethink 
                        design principles and practices through theories of feminism, racism, inclusion, and nonbinary thinking. Extra Bold features interviews, essays, typefaces, and projects from dozens of contributors with a variety of racial and 
                        ethnic backgrounds, abilities, gender identities, and positions of economic and social privilege. The book adds new voices to the dominant design canon. Part textbook and part comic book, zine, manifesto, survival guide, and self-help manual, 
                        Extra Bold is filled with stories and ideas that don't show up in other career books or design overviews. Both pragmatic and inquisitive, the book explores power structures and how to navigate them. Interviews showcase people at different stages of their careers, 
                        and biographical sketches explore individuals marginalized by sexism, racism, and ableism. Jennifer Tobias's original, handcrafted illustrations bring warmth, happiness, humor, and narrative depth. Extra Bold is the design career manual for everyone.

                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        <em> I’ve been looking for queer typography. Is anyone else out there? Who else is searching? I wonder if this is even a valid question. Looking for queer anything often feels lonely. 
                        The word queer resists definition, sometimes aligned with ideas about rejection, refusal, deviating from the expected, away from the normative. It’s certainly a political word, 
                        one that’s taken on expansive qualities throughout its history, qualities that aren’t necessarily confined to gender and sexuality.</em>

                        Chidera Eggerue is a British Nigerian writer, and podcast host. Much of her writing is on feminist issues from a feminist perspective. 
                        That being said, she is not regurgitating feminist critiques from the 90s, or even early 00s. Eggerue's intersectional feminist perspective, 
                        as woman of colour, provides perspectives that challenge those feminist ideals upheld in white society.

                    I wanted to find a succint paragraph that summarises what Pay The Rent is, and why it is important. I started reading through their website
                    and everything written there was important. So the following excerpt does not fully encapsulate their significance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em> Pay The Rent program is organised by First Nations and non-First Nations people working together, as the Pay The Rent Grassroots Collective. 
                    This Collective is based on the lands of the Kulin Nation in Victoria, Australia, however we are a national organisation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Australia is founded on land that was stolen from Indigenous people. The wealth that has been generated by that theft is disproportionately distributed. 
                    All people who live here today, or who have lived here in the past, have not benefited equally from the continuing dispossession of Indigenous people. 
                    Indeed, many are deliberately and profoundly marginalised from power and the spoils of colonialism.

                    Since the failed 2023 Referendum, we as young Aboriginal people, have felt a deep shame and grief because we have felt a silence from our fellow Australians.
