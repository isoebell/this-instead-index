        <p>This Instead Index is never finished. It serves as an information container, responding to the impact that the internet has on communities. The internet can be a space that fosters growth, learning, entertainment, and connections. It is also often an echo chamber, becoming a space where ideologies and values can heighten and go unchallenged. The internet can be a producer of hate, misinformation, and subjugation.
            <br>
            Although there is no reason for this index to be any different from other online spaces, the values of 'This Instead Index' are apparent in the resources shared here.
            <br>
            At <span class="underline">This Instead Index</span> we believe in the power of community and the importance of education. We believe that there is no excuse for bigotry in all its forms. There is no place here for misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism, or ableism.
            <br>
            In fact, we hope that this site can challenge those online spaces where derogatory behaviours thrive.

                <p class="title">A Room of One’s Own, by Virginia Woolf</p>
                <p class="infoText hidden">
                    Why is it that men have always had power, influence, wealth and fame, while women have had nothing but children? 
                    In this essay, first published in 1929, Woolf exhorts young women to take advantage of the opportunities they have.
                    <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, based on a lecture given at Girton College Cambridge, is one of the great feminist polemics. 
                    Woolf’s blazing writing on female creativity, the role of the writer, and the silent fate of Shakespeare’s imaginary sister 
                    remains a powerful reminder of a woman’s need for financial independence and intellectual freedom.

                <p class="infoText hidden">
                    Beloved comedian, podcaster and commentator Price's debut book explores obsession and self-image, 
                    and how while striving to be hot feels natural, particularly in our culture, it is dangerous, homogenous, 
                    and informed by patriarchy. Anchored in her own personal experience, All I Ever Wanted Is to Be Hot is a refreshingly 
                    honest interrogation of how pop culture, the internet and modern beauty ideals intersect to influence our bodies and how we feel about them.

                    This book ... is the culmination of many years of writing about power, abuse, privilege, male entitlement and rape culture. 
                    After all that, here's what I've learned: we should be f*cking terrified.' Clementine Ford, from the introduction of her book.

                <p class="infoText hidden">
                    'I don’t want more prisons and punishment for men – I want to help prevent sexual assault so women are safer in the first place.' 
                    <br>
                    'You see, what I need in a society where the threat of danger is ongoing is not the same as the society I want. I can’t opt out of this reality, 
                    but I can see where we could be and I want to be part of helping us get there. I don’t want more prisons and punishment. I want more prevention. 
                    A small number of men convicted of upskirting have been sentenced to prison under my law (and a significant number of them were also convicted of 
                    other sexual offences; one was found to have 250,000 indecent images of children). While I am thankful that children will be safer because of his conviction, 
                    my work now also asks, “How do we prevent this <em>before</em> we need to criminalise it?”' Excerpt of Gina Martin from article.

                <p class="infoText hidden">
                    The Ladies Lounge at Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art was at the centre of a discrimination complaint from a man who was refused entry earlier in 2024, 
                    with the gallery initially found to have discriminated against him — a finding which was later overturned in the Supreme Court.
                    The artist behind the lounge, Kirsha Kaechele, says the feeling of exclusion felt by men constituted part of the artwork.

                <p class="infoText hidden">
                    I’ve been looking for queer typography. Is anyone else out there? Who else is searching? I wonder if this is even a valid question. Looking for queer anything often feels lonely. 
                    The word queer resists definition, sometimes aligned with ideas about rejection, refusal, deviating from the expected, away from the normative. It’s certainly a political word, 
                    one that’s taken on expansive qualities throughout its history, qualities that aren’t necessarily confined to gender and sexuality.

                    sometimes confusing parts of sex, dating and relationships This podcast is sex positive, inclusive and aims to cover every crevasse of human 
                    sexuality with advice you can actually trust.

                    A developmental and behavioural paediatrician with over twenty years experience, Billy is an expert at up-skilling kids with the fundamental skills of empathy, kindness, compassion and self-esteem.
                    <br>
                    Due to the extremely high demand for his expertise (the clinic waiting list is most likely seven years long at this point), Billy decided to co-produce his own podcast ‘Pop-Culture Parenting’, 
                    and has also just released a book Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child’s Mental Health.
                    <br>
                    In this Academy, Billy gets into the nitty gritty about masculinity, role modelling and teaching emotional regulation to kids, especially young boys (we even talk about porn). Extremely generous in 
                    sharing his own story, Billy reveals the purpose behind his clinic, and how he finds immense privilege in being here to do the work that he does (you’re going to need tissues).
