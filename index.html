                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        Why is it that men have always had power, influence, wealth and fame, while women have had nothing but children? 
                        In this essay, first published in 1929, Woolf exhorts young women to take advantage of the opportunities they have.
                        <em>A Room of One’s Own</em>, based on a lecture given at Girton College Cambridge, is one of the great feminist polemics. 
                        Woolf’s blazing writing on female creativity, the role of the writer, and the silent fate of Shakespeare’s imaginary sister 
                        remains a powerful reminder of a woman’s need for financial independence and intellectual freedom.

                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        Beloved comedian, podcaster and commentator Price's debut book explores obsession and self-image, 
                        and how while striving to be hot feels natural, particularly in our culture, it is dangerous, homogenous, 
                        and informed by patriarchy. Anchored in her own personal experience, All I Ever Wanted Is to Be Hot is a refreshingly 
                        honest interrogation of how pop culture, the internet and modern beauty ideals intersect to influence our bodies and how we feel about them.

                        This book ... is the culmination of many years of writing about power, abuse, privilege, male entitlement and rape culture.

                        'I don’t want more prisons and punishment for men – I want to help prevent sexual assault so women are safer in the first place.' 
                        <br>

                        but I can see where we could be and I want to be part of helping us get there. I don’t want more prisons and punishment. I want more prevention. 
                        A small number of men convicted of upskirting have been sentenced to prison under my law (and a significant number of them were also convicted of 
                        other sexual offences; one was found to have 250,000 indecent images of children). While I am thankful that children will be safer because of his conviction,

                        The Ladies Lounge at Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art was at the centre of a discrimination complaint from a man who was refused entry earlier in 2024, 
                        with the gallery initially found to have discriminated against him — a finding which was later overturned in the Supreme Court.
                        The artist behind the lounge, Kirsha Kaechele, says the feeling of exclusion felt by men constituted part of the artwork.

                        I’ve been looking for queer typography. Is anyone else out there? Who else is searching? I wonder if this is even a valid question. Looking for queer anything often feels lonely. 
                        The word queer resists definition, sometimes aligned with ideas about rejection, refusal, deviating from the expected, away from the normative. It’s certainly a political word, 
                        one that’s taken on expansive qualities throughout its history, qualities that aren’t necessarily confined to gender and sexuality.

                        Chidera Eggerue is a British Nigerian writer, and podcast host. Much of her writing is on feminist issues from a feminist perspective. 
                        That being said, she is not regurgitating feminist critiques from the 90s, or even early 00s. Eggerue's intersectional feminist perspective, 
                        as woman of colour, provides perspectives that challenge those feminist ideals upheld in white society.
                        <br>
                        Chidera Eggerue is worth following, reading, and listening to.

                        You need to learn how to be good at sex, but none of us were ever taught. Georgia has dedicated her life to helping more people feel 
                        comfortable and fulfilled during sex and she wants to bring these essential conversations outside of the therapy room and into the comfort 
                        of your space. Every Tuesday G drops a mini episode to give straight forward advice and tools to improve sex and relationships. Then every 
                        Thursday, G is joined by a different co-host to discuss an element of human sexuality that’s close to them. Talking about sex can be hard, 
                        but good conversations about pleasure start outside the bedroom. These experts offer tools, anecdotes and personal dilemmas to normalise the 
                        sometimes confusing parts of sex, dating and relationships This podcast is sex positive, inclusive and aims to cover every crevasse of human 
                        sexuality with advice you can actually trust.

                        Dr Billy Garvey gets kids.
                        <br>
                        A developmental and behavioural paediatrician with over twenty years experience, Billy is an expert at up-skilling kids with the fundamental skills of empathy, kindness, compassion and self-esteem.
                        <br>
                        Due to the extremely high demand for his expertise (the clinic waiting list is most likely seven years long at this point), Billy decided to co-produce his own podcast ‘Pop-Culture Parenting’, 
                        and has also just released a book Ten Things I Wish You Knew About Your Child’s Mental Health.
                        <br>
                        In this Academy, Billy gets into the nitty gritty about masculinity, role modelling and teaching emotional regulation to kids, especially young boys (we even talk about porn). Extremely generous in 
                        sharing his own story, Billy reveals the purpose behind his clinic, and how he finds immense privilege in being here to do the work that he does (you’re going to need tissues).
