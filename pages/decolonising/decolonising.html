                        I wanted to find a succint paragraph that summarises what Pay The Rent is, and why it is important. I started reading through their website
                        and everything written there was important. So the following excerpt does not fully encapsulate their significance.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <em> Pay The Rent program is organised by First Nations and non-First Nations people working together, as the Pay The Rent Grassroots Collective. 
                        This Collective is based on the lands of the Kulin Nation in Victoria, Australia, however we are a national organisation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Australia is founded on land that was stolen from Indigenous people. The wealth that has been generated by that theft is disproportionately distributed. 
                        All people who live here today, or who have lived here in the past, have not benefited equally from the continuing dispossession of Indigenous people. 
                        Indeed, many are deliberately and profoundly marginalised from power and the spoils of colonialism.

                        <em>Jack Charles has worn many hats throughout his life: actor, cat burglar, musician, heroin addict, activist, even Senior Victorian Australian of the Year. But the title he’s most proud to claim is that of Aboriginal Elder.
                        <br>
                        Stolen from his mother and placed into institutional care when he was only a few months old, Uncle Jack was raised under the government’s White Australia Policy. 
                        The loneliness and isolation he experienced during those years had a devastating impact on him that endured long after he reconnected with his Aboriginal roots and discovered his stolen identity. 
                        Even today he feels like an outsider; a loner; a fringe dweller.
                        <br>
                        In this honest and no-holds-barred memoir, Uncle Jack reveals the ‘ups and downs of this crazy, drugged up, locked up, fucked up, and at times unbelievable, life’. 
                        From his sideline as a cat burglar, battles with drug addiction and stints in prison, to gracing the nation’s stages and screens as he dazzled audiences with his big personality and acting prowess, he takes us through the most formative moments of his life.

                        <em>Provocative, funny and profoundly moving, BASTARDY is the inspirational story of a self-proclaimed Robin Hood of the streets. 
                        For 40 years and with infectious humour and optimism, Jack Charles has juggled a life of crime with another successful career - acting. 
                        Since founding the first Aboriginal theatre company in the 1970s, Jack has performed with Australia’s most renowned actors and directors in feature films, TV series and hundreds of plays. 
                        Filmmaker Amiel Courtin-Wilson follows Jack over seven years - gradually blurring the line between director and accomplice as Jack continually traverses the criminal and acting worlds. 
                        However, the law finally catches up with Jack and when he faces a jail sentence he might not survive, he is forced to decide if he can go straight for the first time in his life. BASTARDY is the story of one man’s journey into the light.

                        Chidera Eggerue is a British Nigerian writer, and podcast host. Much of her writing is on feminist issues from a feminist perspective. 
                        That being said, she is not regurgitating feminist critiques from the 90s, or even early 00s. Eggerue's intersectional feminist perspective, 
                        as woman of colour, provides perspectives that challenge those feminist ideals upheld in white society.
                        <br>
                        Chidera Eggerue is worth following, reading, and listening to.

                        <em>Founded in 2001, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) is Australia’s largest human rights organisation providing support to people seeking asylum.
                        <br>
                        We are an independent not-for-profit organisation whose programs support and empower people seeking asylum to maximise their own physical, mental and social wellbeing.
                        <br>
                        We champion the rights of people seeking asylum and mobilise a community of compassion to create lasting social and policy change.
                        <br>
                        The ASRC movement is proudly supported by a community of committed volunteers and supporters.
