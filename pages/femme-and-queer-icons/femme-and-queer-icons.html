                        Whether you want to know more on a topic, or you simply need to destress after scrolling online, hopefully you can find something here.

                        <p class="infoText hidden">
                            Chidera Eggerue is a British Nigerian writer, and podcast host. Much of her writing is on feminist issues from a feminist perspective. 
                            That being said, she is not regurgitating feminist critiques from the 90s, or even early 00s. Eggerue's intersectional feminist perspective, 
                            as woman of colour, provides perspectives that challenge those feminist ideals upheld in white society.
                            <br>
                            Chidera Eggerue is worth following, reading, and listening to.
