                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        <em>Extra Bold is the inclusive, practical, and informative career handbook for designers that we've all been waiting for. Written collaboratively by a diverse team of authors, the book opens with critical essays that rethink 
                        design principles and practices through theories of feminism, racism, inclusion, and nonbinary thinking. Extra Bold features interviews, essays, typefaces, and projects from dozens of contributors with a variety of racial and 
                        ethnic backgrounds, abilities, gender identities, and positions of economic and social privilege. The book adds new voices to the dominant design canon. Part textbook and part comic book, zine, manifesto, survival guide, and self-help manual, 
                        Extra Bold is filled with stories and ideas that don't show up in other career books or design overviews. Both pragmatic and inquisitive, the book explores power structures and how to navigate them. Interviews showcase people at different stages of their careers, 
                        and biographical sketches explore individuals marginalized by sexism, racism, and ableism. Jennifer Tobias's original, handcrafted illustrations bring warmth, happiness, humor, and narrative depth. Extra Bold is the design career manual for everyone.
