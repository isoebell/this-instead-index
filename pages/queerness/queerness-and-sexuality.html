                        You may not be gay, but its still cool to read about compulsory heterosexuality, and gauge new perspectives on the impact that patriarchy has on our relationships with others, and ourselves.

                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        Iris Marion Young was an American political theorist and socialist feminist who focused on the nature of justice and social difference in the late 20th century.
                        <br>
                        Iris Marion Young discusses the impact that the lived experience of being raised as a girl can have on the way that girls, and women, 
                        relate, move and trust their body in the everyday.

                    <p class="infoText hidden">
                        I’ve been looking for queer typography. Is anyone else out there? Who else is searching? I wonder if this is even a valid question. Looking for queer anything often feels lonely. 
                        The word queer resists definition, sometimes aligned with ideas about rejection, refusal, deviating from the expected, away from the normative. It’s certainly a political word, 
                        one that’s taken on expansive qualities throughout its history, qualities that aren’t necessarily confined to gender and sexuality.

                        You need to learn how to be good at sex, but none of us were ever taught. Georgia has dedicated her life to helping more people feel 
                        comfortable and fulfilled during sex and she wants to bring these essential conversations outside of the therapy room and into the comfort 
                        of your space. Every Tuesday G drops a mini episode to give straight forward advice and tools to improve sex and relationships. Then every 
                        Thursday, G is joined by a different co-host to discuss an element of human sexuality that’s close to them. Talking about sex can be hard, 
                        but good conversations about pleasure start outside the bedroom. These experts offer tools, anecdotes and personal dilemmas to normalise the 
                        sometimes confusing parts of sex, dating and relationships This podcast is sex positive, inclusive and aims to cover every crevasse of human 
                        sexuality with advice you can actually trust.
