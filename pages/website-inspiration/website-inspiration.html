                        <br>
                        We hope that this site can challenge those online spaces where bigotry thrives. 
                        Instead, providing an information container of resources and links that are [cool, interesting, or helpful]. 
                        Whether you want to know more on a topic, or you simply need to destress after scrolling online, hopefully you can find something here.

                        I’m a designer with a penchant for organising information. Originally from country Australia, I have worked independently and in branding studios across Sydney, 
                        Berlin and New York City. I now run a small branding studio called Super Keen.
